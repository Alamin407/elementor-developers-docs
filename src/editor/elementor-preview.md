# Elementor Preview

Elementor Preview is the area that displays the live preview. It rendered by a JavaScript engine, typically without loading from the server side. In other words this is the area where you can see how the site will look like.

## Extending the Preview

The preview area is part of [The Editor](./elementor-editor), meaning that it inherits some editing features allowing users to control the look and feel. Developers can use those features to extend the Preview. For Example:

* [Inline Editing](/widgets/rendering-inline-editing) - When developing [Elementor Widgets](/widgets/) you can make the element editable right from the Preview area.
* [Context Menu](/context-menu/) - When right-clicking the element in the Preview you can add action links to the contextual popup.
* **Edit Buttons** - When hovering over the element in the Preview you can add new edit buttons.
