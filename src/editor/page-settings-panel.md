The **Page Settings** is a panel in [The Editor](/editor/) where the user can change the Post/Page fields like the title, the excerpt (if the post type supports excerpts), feature image etc.

## Structure and Functionality

The panel has three tabs:

* **Settings** - Manage general page settings.
* **Style** - Manage page styling.
* **Advanced** - Other page settings.

The settings panel is Elementor's equivalent to the WordPress post/page edit screen. This where you can set page title, excerpt, feature image etc.

Style settings used to add new styling on a page level. Unlike the site settings where you control site-wide styles. For example, users can change the page background color/image, overriding the site background style.

In the advanced tab users can add custom CSS loaded only on this page.
