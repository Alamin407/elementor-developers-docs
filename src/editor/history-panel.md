The **History Settings** is a panel in [The Editor](/editor/) where the user can see his latest actions and revisions. This panel let's the user to undo / redo his actions and restore previous versions of the page.

## Structure and Functionality

The panel has two tabs, each serving a different purpose:

* **Revisions** - Page versions saved in the database.
* **Actions** - Page changes made since the page was last saved.

Revisions are WordPress functionality, Elementor only makes it easy to restore different revisions already saved in WordPress database.

Actions, on the other hand, are changes made by the user inside Elementor. The panel makes it easy to display the changes made and undo / redo those changes.
