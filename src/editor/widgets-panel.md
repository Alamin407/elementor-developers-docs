The **Widgets Panel** is the gate panel in [The Editor](/editor/) from where the user can drag & drop widgets to the [Elementor Preview](./elementor-preview).

## Structure and Functionality

The panel has two tabs, each serving a different purpose:

* **Elements** - A list of the registered widgets.
* **Global** - A list of widgets saved by the user.

The Elements tab displays the sites widgets grouped by categories. It also has a search bar which can be used to filter the widgets.

Global tab displays all the saved widgets with their settings and designs. Global widgets can be used in multiple areas and multiple pages. Changing the global widget affects all the instances on all the pages.

## Extending the Widgets Panel

Elementor offers dozens of widgets out-of-the-box, nevertheless, external developers can [create new widgets](/widgets/) and even organize them in their own branded [widget categories](/widgets/widget-categories).
