The editor is the environment in which users create pages and control site settings. The editor is a general term that includes two main areas. Each of these areas contains inner areas which can be extended by 3rd party developers.

## Structure

The editor includes the entire editing screen and consists of two main areas:

* [Elementor Preview](./elementor-preview)
* [Elementor Panel](./elementor-panel)

* [Menu Panel](./menu-panel)
* [Site Settings Panel](./site-settings-panel)
* [User Preferences Panel](./user-preferences-panel)
* [Page Settings Panel](./page-settings-panel)
