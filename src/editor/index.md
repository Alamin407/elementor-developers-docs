The editor is the environment in which users create pages and control site settings. The editor is a general term that includes several areas. Each of these areas consists of several inner areas. These inner areas are sometimes extended by 3rd party developers.

## Structure

The editor includes the entire editing screen consisting of two main areas:

* [Elementor Preview](./elementor-preview)
* [Elementor Panel](./elementor-panel)
