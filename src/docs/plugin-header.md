# Plugin Header

The plugin's main PHP file `plugin-name.php` should include header comment with basic information about the plugin. For the full list available header fields see [WordPress Header Requirements](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/header-requirements/).

## Basic Plugin Header

To get started, we are going to use some very basic fields.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Elementor Test Extension
 * Description: Custom Elementor extension.
 * Plugin URI:  https://elementor.com/
 * Version:     1.0.0
 * Author:      Elementor Developer
 * Author URI:  https://developers.elementor.com/
 * Text Domain: elementor-test-extension
 */
```

## Elementor Header

Elementor has it's own plugin header where you can set the heights Elementor version that the plugin was tested against. This is an optional header, but we recommend using it.

```php
/**
 * Elementor tested up to: 3.3.0
 */
```
