# Guidelines

As part of our ongoing efforts to build a larger eco-system, we have created a list of guidelines for our developer community. Extending basic capabilities should be according to our philosophy and design principals. Your addons should be consistent with Elementor goals.

## WordPress Dashboard

### Sidebar Menus

Some addons add new settings panels on WordPress dashboard.

* **Don't pollute WordPress sidebar** - Try to use as few sidebar menus as possible.
* **Short menu labels** - Use short menu labels for your menus. Avoid long labels that slide into two lines.

### Elementor Settings Screen

Some addons add their own settings to Elementor's settings screen.

* **Registering setting** - Use official methods to register your settings.
* **Setting tabs** - Register new settings tabs properly.
* **API keys** - Do not ask for API keys Elementor already asking for (i.e. Google Maps API).

## Elementor Editor

### Editor Panels

* **Avoid code workarounds** - Use official methods to extend Elementor Panels.
* **Use official colors** - Adopt Elementor colors, try not to add flashy colors to The Editor.

### Widgets

* **Icons colors** - Use the same colors in your icons as Elementor.
* **Animated icons** - Avoid using animated icons.

## Changes

If you have suggestions to improve the guidelines, or questions about them, please let us know. Use the developers github repository to submit issues and pull requests.
