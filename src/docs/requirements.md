# Requirements

To create a new Elementor addon, you'll need an active server running WordPress and Elementor.

## Server Requirements

You can use the basic [server requirements required to run WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). However, to protect your environment and make it faster, it is recommended that you do not rely on [basic environment setup](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/) and instead utilize the most recent software versions.

Furthermore, you should check the minimum PHP version required to run Elementor. Make sure your addon is using a higher PHP version.

## Required Plugins & Themes

When developing new Elementor addon we recommend to use a clean WordPress installation with [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) and [Hello Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/). If you plan to extent Pro features you should also install [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro/).
