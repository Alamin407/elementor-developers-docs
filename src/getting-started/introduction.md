# Introduction

For five years, weâ€™ve been proud to help web creators build websites by providing them with the premier page and site building software available. In turn, the Elementor community has inspired developers around the world to create powerful extensions, sophisticated widgets, integrate with third-party services, integrate CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries, customized themes, further broadening the capabilities of Elementor.

Now, in order to further support and encourage the developer community, Elementor has created this updated and revised hub where developers can access detailed, current documentation, clearly explaining how Elementor works and the options it provides developers.

With over 9 million websites currently powered by Elementor, the demand for new developer-created tools is constantly growing. We believe that investing in this hub will make creating these tools faster and easier than ever before.
