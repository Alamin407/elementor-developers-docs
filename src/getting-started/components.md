# Elementor Components

Developers can extend different parts of Elementor. The docs include several components with more to come. Each component has a short explanation how it works, and indepth tutorials explaining how you can modify it. In addition, each component has full code examples showing you how to create an addon from scratch. You can copy the code, modifying it for your needs and learn as you go.

## Available Components

* [Context Menu](/context-menu/)

  When editing elements in the preview area, you can right click an element and access actions that can be applied on the element. Developers can add custom actions the context menus. Learn how to do that.

* [Finder](/finder/)



* [Widgets](/widgets/)



* [Controls](/controls/)



* [Dynamic Tags](/dynamic-tags/)



* [Themes](/themes/)



## More Components

Stay tuned as we are working new tutorials for new components. Keep in mind that some components take more time to be documented as we need to rewrite way Elementor code works to allow 3rd party code to be integrated into Elementor Core.

You can be sure that are doing everything to simplify our codebase in order to make it easier for external developers to implement their ideas over the Elementor infrastructure.
