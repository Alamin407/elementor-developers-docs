# What is Elementor?

For five years, weâ€™ve been proud to help web creators build websites by providing them with the best page and site building software available. In turn, the Elementor community has inspired developers around the world to create powerful extensions, sophisticated widgets, JavaScript libraries, customized themes and ways to integrate with third-party services. All of these have contributed to broadening the capabilities of Elementor.

Now, in order to further support and encourage the developer community, Elementor has created this updated and revised docs center where developers can access detailed, up-to-date documentation, clearly explaining how Elementor works and the options it provides developers.

With over 9 million websites currently powered by Elementor, the demand for new developer-created tools is constantly growing. We believe that investing in this site will make creating these tools faster and easier than ever before.
