# What is an Elementor addon?

Before you start planning and developing your Elementor addon, it’s important to understand what addons are and how they fit into Elementor. Addons are a way third party developers can extend the Elementor’s functionality, add new features, integrate external services, customize workflow and more.  

## The Elementor economy

Over the years, developers have created hundreds of custom addons for Elementor, including widgets, templates, graphs, sliders, custom popups and more.  These addons are then marketed and sold to millions of Elementor users as part of an ever growing Elementor economy.

Some examples of these addons include:

* Advanced Widgets
* Forms integrations
* New Dynamic tags
* Popups
* Lead collection
* Animations
* Custom Fonts and Font Icons
