A context menu is a popup menu that appears when users right click an element in the [Elementor preview](./editor/elementor-preview) area. This popup menu offers a set of available actions based on location or the selected element. That is why it is called a context menu.

## Context Menu Structure

Elementor has several [types](./context-menu/context-menu-types) of context menus based on the selected element or its location. Developers can hook to any element type and modify its actions.

Each menu is divided into several [groups](./context-menu/context-menu-groups), each containing several items. Context menu groups are visually divided with separators.

Each menu item is called an [action](./context-menu/context-menu-actions). Actions are JS callback functions applied to selected elements (section, column, widget).

## Extending Context Menus

External developers can register their own custom actions and modify existing ones.

Learn to manage groups:

* [Add New Context Menu Group](./context-menu/add-new-group)
* [Remove Context Menu Group](./context-menu/remove-group)
* [Update Context Menu Group](./context-menu/update-group)

Learn to manage actions:

* [Add New Context Menu Action](./context-menu/add-new-action)
* [Remove Context Menu Action](./context-menu/remove-action)
* [Update Context Menu Action](./context-menu/update-action)
