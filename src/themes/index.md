**Elementor Pro 2.0** introduced the **Theme Builder**. This feature transformed Elementor from a regular page-builder to a full site-builder. Developers can make **Elementor Compatible Themes** by supporting the **Theme Locations** functionality.

## Overview

Previously, Elementor was a regular page-builder working only with areas inside [the_content()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_content/) of a single page. You couldnâ€™t really use Elementor to set global headers/footers, design custom archive pages or content pages!

The new "Theme Builder" functionality changed everything! The weight has shifted from theme developers to the users. Users no longer need to rely on pre-designed themes, the can design their own layouts. Surprisingly, themes that adopted the change saw an increase in the amount of downloads and overall usage.

## Elementor Compatibility
